This is the Game Of Life.
This project is written in java script in order to better understand javaScript language , HTML and CSS; 
This game was written by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
This project will be written using the Conway's original game rules :

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
